# Changelog

## v0.1.0

### Highlights
- First public release of `openwrt-captive-monitor` packaged for OpenWrt.
- Captive portal detection with automated DNS and HTTP interception for LAN clients.
- Seamless cleanup once internet access is restored, including dnsmasq overrides,
  NAT rules, and temporary HTTP server assets.

### Networking & Compatibility
- Support for both `iptables` and `nftables` firewalls, including IPv4/IPv6 NAT
  redirect rules and safe teardown.
- WiFi recovery helpers that recycle the logical or physical STA interface when
  captive checks repeatedly fail.
- BusyBox `ash`-compatible scripting style validated with ShellCheck to avoid
  POSIX regressions on OpenWrt targets.

### Packaging & Tooling
- OpenWrt package layout with `/usr/sbin`, `/etc/init.d`, `/etc/config`, and
  `uci-defaults` assets wired for procd service management.
- GitHub Actions workflows covering ShellCheck linting plus matrix builds
  against official OpenWrt SDKs to produce `.ipk` artifacts and feed indexes.
- `scripts/build_ipk.sh` helper to assemble release-ready `.ipk` packages along
  with `Packages`/`Packages.gz` indexes for publishing custom opkg feeds.
