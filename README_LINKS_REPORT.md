## URL Issues (5/14)
The following GitHub repository links return 404, likely due to:
- Private repository status
- GitHub features not enabled
- No releases created yet

### Issues:
1. ❌ 404: https://github.com/nagual2/openwrt-captive-monitor/discussions
2. ❌ 404: https://github.com/nagual2/openwrt-captive-monitor/issues
3. ❌ 404: https://github.com/nagual2/openwrt-captive-monitor/releases
4. ❌ 404: https://github.com/nagual2/openwrt-captive-monitor/security/advisories
5. ❌ 404: https://nagual2.github.io/openwrt-captive-monitor/

### Recommendations:
1. **Enable GitHub Features**: Ensure Issues, Discussions, and Releases are enabled in repository settings
2. **Create First Release**: Create an initial release to make the releases page accessible
3. **Documentation Site**: Set up GitHub Pages for the documentation site
4. **Repository Visibility**: Consider making repository public or use alternative badge URLs

## Local Files (10/10 ✅)
All local files referenced in README exist:
- ✅ .github/SECURITY.md
- ✅ CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- ✅ CONTRIBUTING.md
- ✅ LICENSE
- ✅ docs/configuration/basic-config.md
- ✅ docs/configuration/reference.md
- ✅ docs/guides/architecture.md
- ✅ docs/guides/troubleshooting.md
- ✅ docs/project/management.md
- ✅ docs/usage/quick-start.md

## Fixed Issues
1. ✅ **Added Missing Badges**: Restored CI/build, release, license, and OpenWrt badges
2. ✅ **Fixed Badge URLs**: Corrected CI badge URL format
3. ✅ **Removed Duplicate TOC**: Eliminated duplicate table of contents entries
4. ✅ **Updated Title**: Changed from "openwrt-captive-monitor" to "OpenWrt Captive Monitor"

## Remaining Considerations
- Anchor links (internal page navigation) are working correctly
- GitHub repository links may work once repository is public or features are enabled
- All documentation structure is intact and accessible

## Overall Status: ✅ GOOD
The README has been successfully restored with proper badges and all internal links are working. The remaining URL issues are external repository configuration issues that don't affect the documentation quality.
